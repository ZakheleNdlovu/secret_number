This is a number guessing game.

It is created with C++.

The user has limited chances to guess a number between 1 and 50.

If the guess is higher than the secret number, the program will return "Your guess is higher than the secret number"

If the guess is lower than the secret number, the program will return "Your guess is higher than the secret number"

If you run out of lives before you guess the number, the game will stop.
